94. Linux Account Authentication
  # if you have thousand of users to the system then how can we manage those users and change the passwords
  # let say you have to create a user to the multiple servers for that to login to every server and create the user it is not a good thing 
    right 
  # for that they create the directory service where user could log in having the authentication through a different server.

@@ Types of Accounts 
  # Local accounts  == here we create user locally 
  # Domain/Directory accounts == here we create the users to multiple servers then we have a domain or directory accounts on server

138) Enable internet on linux VM

  # we will cover different components of networking and how the networking works in a linux environment but before allow the network 
  we have to give internet access to the vm.
  steps:
    # Open Virtualbox manager
    # Select the machine you cannot get internet on in the left pane.
    # Click the settings button in the top menu.
    # Click Network in the left pane in the settings window.
    # Switched to Bridged Adaptor in the Attached to drop-down menu.
    # Hit OK to save your changes.
    # Start your VM.

  ## Gateway
      In networking, a gateway is a device or a node in a computer network that serves as an entry and exit point for data traffic.             Gateways are used to connect different networks that may use different communication protocols, data formats, or architectures.           They facilitate communication between networks by translating and forwarding data between them.

      Here are a few types of gateways commonly used in networking:

      Router as a Gateway:
        In many home or small office networks, a router often serves as a gateway. It connects the local network to the internet and              manages the flow of data between the local network and the external network (typically the internet).
        Routers use protocols such as TCP/IP to enable communication between devices on the local network and devices on remote networks

      Default Gateway:
        In TCP/IP networks, the default gateway is a specific router that is designated for forwarding traffic from the local network to          destinations outside the local network (e.g., the internet).
        When a device in a local network wants to communicate with a device outside the local network, it sends the data to the default           gateway, which then forwards it to the appropriate destination.

      API Gateway:
        In the context of web services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), an API gateway is a server that acts as an API              front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and              then passing the response back to the requester.

      Firewall as a Gateway:
         A firewall often serves as a gateway between a private network and the public internet. It regulates the incoming and outgoing            network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
