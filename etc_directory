## The /etc directory in Linux is a central location for configuration files and directories 
that are used by the system and various applications. 

## 
Configuration files are plain text files used by software applications to store settings and parameters.
These files contain instructions that define how the software should behave or operate. 
Users and administrators can edit these files to customize the behavior of the software 
according to their preferences or specific requirements. Configuration files help 
separate the settings of an application from its code, making it easier to modify 
the software's behavior without changing its underlying program.

## while it does contain additional information, the primary purpose of /etc/passwd is to store user account details, 
with the password aspect usually managed separately in the /etc/shadow file for security reasons

note : In etc directory has a lot of files but we will focus few files that we will discuss.

# /etc/passwd 
    This file stores user account information. It includes usernames, encrypted passwords, user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), 
    home directories, and login shells.
    note : while it does contain additional information, the primary purpose of /etc/passwd is to store user account details,
    with the password aspect usually managed separately in the /etc/shadow file for security reasons.

# /etc/shadow
    the /etc/shadow file in Linux stores encrypted passwords and additional security settings for user accounts. 
    It keeps this sensitive information secure by restricting access to only the root user.
    The file includes details such as when the password was last changed, when it will expire, and other security-related parameters.

# /etc/group
    The /etc/group file in Linux contains information about user groups on the system.
    Each line in this file represents a group and includes details such as the group name, group password (which is rarely used), 
    group ID (GID), and a list of users who are members of that group. 
    This file helps manage user groups, which are collections of user accounts that share common 
    permissions and access rights to files and resources on the system.

# /etc/hostname
    The /etc/hostname file in Linux contains the hostname of the system. The hostname is the name by which the system identifies itself on a network.
    This file typically contains a single line with the hostname, and its primary purpose is to store and retrieve the system's assigned name.
    The hostname is used for network communication and can be important for various network-related configurations.

# /etc/hosts
    
    The /etc/hosts file in Linux is a simple text file used to map IP addresses to hostnames locally on the system.
    It allows the system to resolve domain names to IP addresses without relying on a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
