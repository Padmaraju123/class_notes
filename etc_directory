## The /etc directory in Linux is a central location for configuration files and directories 
that are used by the system and various applications. 

## 
Configuration files are plain text files used by software applications to store settings and parameters.
These files contain instructions that define how the software should behave or operate. 
Users and administrators can edit these files to customize the behavior of the software 
according to their preferences or specific requirements. Configuration files help 
separate the settings of an application from its code, making it easier to modify 
the software's behavior without changing its underlying program.

## while it does contain additional information, the primary purpose of /etc/passwd is to store user account details, 
with the password aspect usually managed separately in the /etc/shadow file for security reasons

note : In etc directory has a lot of files but we will focus few files that we will discuss.

# /etc/passwd 
    This file stores user account information. It includes usernames, encrypted passwords, user IDs (UIDs), group IDs (GIDs), 
    home directories, and login shells.
    note : while it does contain additional information, the primary purpose of /etc/passwd is to store user account details,

# /etc/shadow
    the /etc/shadow file in Linux stores encrypted passwords and additional security settings for user accounts. 
    It keeps this sensitive information secure by restricting access to only the root user.
    The file includes details such as when the password was last changed, when it will expire, and other security-related parameters.
