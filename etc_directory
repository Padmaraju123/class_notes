## The /etc directory in Linux is a central location for configuration files and directories 
that are used by the system and various applications. 

## 
Configuration files are plain text files used by software applications to store settings and parameters.
These files contain instructions that define how the software should behave or operate. 
Users and administrators can edit these files to customize the behavior of the software 
according to their preferences or specific requirements. Configuration files help 
separate the settings of an application from its code, making it easier to modify 
the software's behavior without changing its underlying program.

## while it does contain additional information, the primary purpose of /etc/passwd is to store user account details, 
with the password aspect usually managed separately in the /etc/shadow file for security reasons
