How to create branch

1)what is master branch?
    #whenever we enter a git init command it will create a master branch
2)what is branch?
    #if you copy the code then it will create branch of master branch

3)to see list of available branches and put the star infront of branch which stands for current branch where we are.
    #git branch

4)to list out the commits in the repo
    #git log --oneline

        sub branch then it wont show the files in master 
    5)to add the file
        #git add filename

        other wise if you are in master branch it won't show the sub branch commits

6)how to change the branch
    #git checkout branch_name

7)how to delete a branch
