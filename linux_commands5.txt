NIC = Network Interface Card
  NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is a hardware component that allows computers to connect to a network and communicate with      other devices over that network. NICs are also commonly referred to as network adapters or network cards. The primary function of a NIC 
  is to provide the necessary physical and data link layer interfaces to enable a computer to join a local area network (LAN) or a wide 
  area network (WAN). Here are some key points about NICs:

Physical Connection: NICs are responsible for the physical connection between a computer and the network medium, which could be wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi). The physical medium determines the type of NIC required (e.g., Ethernet NIC, Wi-Fi NIC).

Data Link Layer: NICs operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They encapsulate data into frames and include information such as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses for communication on the local network.

MAC Address: Each NIC is assigned a unique MAC address (Media Access Control address), which is a hardware address burned into the NIC during manufacturing. The MAC address is used for addressing and identifying devices on a network.

Network Connectivity: NICs are essential for connecting computers to networks, enabling them to send and receive data over the network. They play a crucial role in facilitating communication between devices in a local network and beyond.

Integration: NICs can be integrated into a computer's motherboard (onboard NIC) or installed as a separate expansion card. Onboard NICs are common in modern computers, while older or specialized systems may require the installation of a separate NIC.

Types of NICs:

Ethernet NIC: Commonly used for wired LAN connections, supporting Ethernet standards.
Wi-Fi NIC: Used for wireless connections, allowing devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks.
Fiber NIC: Designed for high-speed fiber optic network connections.
Token Ring NIC: Historically used for token ring networks (now less common).
Driver Software: NICs require driver software to interface with the operating system of the computer. Operating systems come with built-in drivers for common NICs, but specialized or newer NICs may require additional driver installation.
