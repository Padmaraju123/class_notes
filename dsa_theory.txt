data structure: it is a storage that is used to store and organize data.it is a way of
arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

# it's not only used for organizing the data. it is also used for processing,retrieving and
storing data.

#data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory

difference between data type and data structures

datatype 
# the data type is the form of a 
variable to which a value can be
assigned.it defines that the particular variable
will assign the values of the given data type only

data structure
#it is a collection of different kinds of data
that entire data can be represented using an 
object and can be used throughout the program

data type
#there is no time complexity in the case of
data types

dsa
#in dsa time complexity plays an important role

data type
#data type examples are int,string,float,etc,.

das
#array,stack,queues etc,.


## data structures has many different uses in our daily life which is used 
for different mathematical and logical problems
## by using dsa one can organize and process a very large amount of data
in a relatively short period.


Linear data structure
## in which data elements are arranged sequencially or linearly,where
each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements

Static data structure
## it has fixed memory size.it is easier to access the elements in a
static data structure
ex: array

Dynamic data structure
## it has no fixed memory size. It can be randomly updated during the run time
which may be considered efficient concering space complexity of the code
ex: queue,stack,linked list
