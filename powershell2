User Input

Now that we can hold data using variables, we can look at a useful command that enables user input through the terminal.
PS > $my_input = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a number"
The above example will output the -Prompt string and then wait for the user to input a value and hit Enter. The value will then be stored in $my_input for use later.

Variable Types and Advanced Usage
In this exercise, we will discuss how variable types are handled in PowerShell and a few advanced ways to interact with variables, including enforcing types, creating multiple variables, and a few variable-related cmdlets.

Variable Types
The following are some common types of variables:

Int: integers like 2, -5, 99
String: zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes like "Codecademy!", "3X4mP|3"
Boolean: two possible values: $True and $False
Array: a collection of items like 25, "red", $False, 16.30
PowerShell assigns a type to the variable depending on the value we assign to it. This is called dynamic typing. The default type of any uninitialized variable is $null.

We can append .GetType().Name to the variable reference to determine a variable’s data type.

PS > $my_string_variable = "Hello, World!"
PS > $my_string_variable.GetType().Name
String

Copy to Clipboard

In the example above, we are accessing the Name property of the GetType() method of a variable we initialized.

The GetType() method returns the name and base type property for a variable
Accessing the Name property only returns the data type we desire
The variable’s data type is String
Constrained Variables
If we wish to enforce a certain type on a variable, we can create a constrained variable via casting.

PS > [Int]$age = 25
PS > $age
25

PS > [Int]$age = "twenty five"
Cannot convert value "age" to type "System.Int32". Error: "Input string was not in a correct format."

Copy to Clipboard

When initializing a variable, we specify the type in brackets before referencing the variable. Attempting to assign a value of another type results in an error if PowerShell cannot convert it.

Create Multiple Variables
PowerShell allows us to create multiple variables using one statement. To initialize multiple variables with the same value,

$i = $j = $k = 0

Copy to Clipboard

To assign multiple values to multiple variables,

$number, $color, $bool = 25, "red", $false

Copy to Clipboard

We will next discuss a specific type of variable called an environment variable.
